<h1>Skateboarding</h1>
<p>This website is all about what you need for skateboarding.</p>
<h1>Skate Decks</h1>

<p>The first thing you need is a good deck. Although the quality matters, the design on the bottom of the board matters as well. Its all up to personal preference. Decks can range from sizes of 7.5 inches to 8.75 inches. Again, the sizes are all up to personal preference.</p>
<h1>Griptape</h1>

<p> Gripetape is fundamental for skate tricks. It helps you stay on your board and can also be custom griptape to match your skate deck.</p>
<h1>Wheels and Trucks</h1>

<p>Wheels and trucks are also what you need to skate. Trucks are basically what help you steer. Trucks come in a wide range of style and sizes to help better fit your skatebaord. Wheels are well, wheels. They make you move like any wheel does. Wheels come in different sizes and styles.</p>
<h1> Hardware and Bearings</h1>

<p>Hardware is what helps you put everything together. Bearings are the small circular devices that allow your wheels to roll. A skateboard requires 8, 2 for each wheel.</p>


<p>Another thing I reccomend you get is a skate tool. Although it isn't mandatory, but I'd rather get this than have to carry around 3 different sized wrenches, 1 screwdriver, and 1 size of Allen key. The nice thing is a skate tool has all of these int oone conveient and easy to carry tool.</p>
